### The project is based on below scenario:

>From: Sheila  
>To: Me  
>Subject: Orinoco  
>___
>
>Hi,
>
>I’ve got some great news! Remember my new online sales business I told you about, Orinoco? Well, I managed to >secure investment for it!
>
>We need an initial MVP to demonstrate to the investors. I already have someone working on the back end, but >immediately thought of you for the front end after our conversation. The investors highly value testing, so >if you could also create a test plan at least for the front end to show that it’s part of our roadmap, that >would be incredibly helpful.
>
>Attached you’ll find the software requirements specification.
>
>My back-end developer has already set up APIs for three themed stores. For this first phase, I’ll need the >front end for just one of them, so feel free to choose whichever store inspires you the most: handmade teddy >bears, vintage cameras, or oak furniture.
>
>Looking forward to working with you!
>
>Sheila
